# Drowsiness-Detection
Today drowsy driving is a serious problem that leads to thousands of accidents each year. Drowsiness or fatigue of a driver is the major reason for these road accidents in India, no monitoring device is used to measure the drowsiness of driver. There is a need for a system that can overcome this problem, a system to monitor driver fatigue and give an alert feedback.<br/>
The main purpose of the project is to detect such conditions where the driver is drowsy and not in the state of driving the vehicle and alert him about his condition, so that he can stop the driving and will take some rest. The main objective of this project is to reduce the accidents happening due the drowsiness or the fatigue of the driver.
